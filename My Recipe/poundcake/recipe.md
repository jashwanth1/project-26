How to Make pound cake step by step.....


step 1. To begin, combine the milk, eggs, and vanilla in a medium bowl. Whisk with a fork until just combined and set aside.

step 2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or with a hand mixer), place the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

step 3. Mix on low speed for about 30 seconds or until blended.

step 4. Add the butter and half of the egg mixture.

step 5. Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened.

step 6. Increase the mixer speed to medium (high speed if using a hand mixer) and beat for one minute.

step 7. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining egg mixture, in 2 separate additions, beating about 30 seconds after each addition to combine.

step 8. Be sure not to over-mix, or you’ll incorporate too much air into the batter and your pound cake won’t dome as nicely.

step 9. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon.

step 10. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a thin wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.

step 11. Place the cake on a wire rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Then remove the cake from the pan and cool completely on a wire rack.

step 12. Wrap the cooled cake in plastic wrap or store in a large sealable plastic bag. The wrapped pound cake will keep for several days at room temperature, for one week when refrigerated, or it can be frozen for two months. Enjoy!
